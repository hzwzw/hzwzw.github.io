It takes a long time for me to figure out.

There are many moments that I feel really happy and satified since I graduated from university in 2012. I rarely care about money and cars.
Generally, there are two kinds things will hit me. One is when I learn some new technology or understanding some points, the other is solving some torturous bugs or issues.  

Anyway, In my whole life, it's new thing that gives me power and energy.

These two days, I'm learning [Ruby on rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html), this's really fucking awesome.

I started learning ROR at **30th, March**. Let's keep eyes on me to see when I will be expert in ROR.
